Welcome to the I Ching Project! This repository is designed to offer an interactive experience with I Ching (The Book of Changes), 
allowing users to perform traditional divination using methods such as the 50-yarrow stalk method, three-coin toss, or Meihua Yishu. 
The repository also includes tools to calculate BaZi (八字) and the corresponding five elements (五行).
