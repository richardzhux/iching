To go on an expedition leads to misfortune, with\nnothing gained.\nWu: Marrying a Maiden indicates that it will be foreboding to make moves. There is\nnothing to be gained.\n\nThe Image\nLegge: The waters of a Marsh with Thunder over it form the hexagram of Propriety.\nThe superior man, in accordance with this, having regard to the far-distant end, knows the\nmischief that may be done at the beginning.\nWilhelm/Baynes: Thunder over the lake: the image of The Marrying Maiden. Thus\nthe superior man understands the transitory in the light of the eternity of the end.\nBlofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder over a pool. The Superior Man knows that,\nto achieve an enduring end, he must be aware of his mistakes at the beginning.\nLiu: Thunder over the lake symbolizes the Marrying Girl. The superior man knows\nthe cause of error, and persists in his virtue to the end.\nRitsema/Karcher: Above marsh possessing thunder. Converting Maidenhood. A\nchun tzu uses perpetually completing to know the cracked.\nCleary (1): There is thunder above a lake, making a young girl marry. Thus\nsuperior people persist to the end and know what is wrong.\nCleary (2): Thunder over a lake – Marrying a young girl. Developed people consider\nlasting results and know what is wrong. [The way developed people handle things is that\nbefore they take the time to ask how to start something, they first consider lasting results.\nIf they think of lasting results, they know what is wrong with acting prematurely, like\nmarrying an immature girl. If you understand the meaning of this, you can apply it to\ngovernment and to contemplating mind as well.]\nWu: There is thunder above the marsh; this is Marrying a Maiden. Thus, the jun zi in\nthe pursuit of lasting excellence realizes the flaws and corrects them.\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: In the marriage of a young bride the proper relationship between\nheaven and earth is seen. Nothing could grow or flourish if heaven and earth did not unite.\nThe marriage of a young bride is therefore both the commencement and goal of humanity.\nBut here the desire of pleasure employs movement to attain union. This action will be evil\nbecause the lines are in inappropriate places, and the magnetic three and five are mounted\non dynamic lines.\nLegge: The Chinese phrase for this hexagram might be equivalent to the English \"giving\nin marriage,” but there are some special meanings in this case which must be understood.\nThe Judgment gives a bad auspice because the trigram of the Youngest Daughter is\nbeneath the trigram of the Eldest Son. Since the action of the hexagram begins with the\nlowest trigram, we have two violations of propriety. First, the marriage is initiated by the\nwoman and her friends. She goes unilaterally to her future home instead of the\nbridegroom coming to fetch her. Second, the parties are unequally matched -- there is too\n\ngreat a disparity in their ages. In addition, all the lines in the hexagram except the top and\nthe bottom are in places inappropriate for them. Some commentators insist that the\nsymbol of the contracting of a marriage in this hexagram sets forth some principles which\nshould obtain in the relation between a ruler and his ministers.\nThe growth of things in nature from the interaction of heaven and earth is\nanalogous to the increase of mankind through the interaction between male and female in\nmarriage. The K'ang-hsi editors reconcile this good auspice with the unfavorable\nJudgment by saying: \"The interaction of the yin and yang cannot be dispensed with, but\nwe ought to be careful about it in the beginning in order to prevent mischief in the end.”\nThe error here is that the desire for the marriage originated with the lady, and that she is\nheedless of the disparity in their ages.\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nJudgment: Propriety means that unilateral action is inappropriate.\nThe Superior Man understands that the Work is guided from within, and that choices\nwhich ignore this truth can only retard its progress. (Present actions originate future\nconsequences: pay heed to your choices.)\nThe traditional name for this hexagram is The Marrying Maiden -- a title which\ndoes not convey to modern western readers the subtlety of its symbolism. Blofeld says:\n\"This hexagram is, on the whole, a most unfortunate omen ... We must not suppose that\nit deals only with marriage. What is said about the maiden symbolizes in some way or\nother what we may expect for ourselves within the context of our enquiry.\" The figure is\ncertainly difficult, but \"unfortunate\" only if its import is resisted or denied: any portrayal\nof our situation which eliminates illusion (however painful the realization), must be\nregarded as a positive lesson.\nAlthough the Confucian commentary describes this hexagram in terms of selfseeking aspiration, the wretched protagonist of the figure is not invariably culpable, and\nneither Judgment nor Image imply this. In addition to being at the very bottom of the\nsocial pecking order, the maiden is portrayed as half-blind, crippled and a \"slave.\"\nAlthough condemned by the commentators for importuning a marriage that would raise\nher status, a close reading of the lines reveals that only the sixth place suggests possible\nimpropriety -- the others all contain advice about how one of extremely low status should\ncope with restricted circumstances. The hexagram therefore can deal with either of two\npossible conditions: those involving Propriety and those involving Making-do as an\nadaptation to adversity.\nIn the first instance, it is useful to compare the symbolism here with that of the\npreceding hexagram of Gradual Progress. There we see the organic progression of the\nWork allegorized as the proper marriage of a young woman. In this case, Gradual\nProgress has been turned upside down and the symbolism reversed: this young woman\nimproperly pursues a marriage on her own initiative. Psychologically interpreted, it can be\nregarded as an image of the ego pushing its own agenda or desire for union.\n\nThe ego may move in directions and toward actions that are at variance with the\nintentions and standards of the Self ... The mature adult needs to recognize\neventually his or her relative limitedness vis-à-vis the \"Self- field\" and the cosmic\norganism of which s/he is but a cell. We are subject to the ordering and growth\nintents of the entelechy of the whole.\nE. C. Whitmont -- The Alchemy of Healing\nTo recognize our `relative limitedness “vis-à-vis the Self-field” is to renounce our\nclaim to unilateral action. Though the ego ardently desires a marriage with the Self, only\nthe Self can initiate such a union. Chou Tun I, an early Neo-Confucian, makes an\nobservation which illuminates Legge's Image:\n\"The superior man, in accordance with this, having regard to the far-distant end,\nknows the mischief that may be done at the beginning. The most important things\nin the world are tendencies. Tendencies may be strong or weak. If a tendency is\nextremely strong, it cannot be controlled. But it is possible to control it quickly if\none realizes that it is strong. To control it requires effort. If one does not realize\nearly enough, it will not be easy to apply effort.”\nTo receive this hexagram without changing lines can be an admonition to examine\nyour motives and actions in the matter at hand. Where are you out of line? If no obvious\nimpropriety is involved, it could also portray an essentially impotent predicament. At such\ntimes Ritsema/Karcher's synopsis bears repetition: \"This hexagram describes your\nsituation in terms of the changing status of someone who cannot control their\ncircumstances. It emphasizes that finding a real field of activity through accepting this\nimposition is the adequate way to handle it.”\nSUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION\nCompare Propriety with hexagram number fifty-three, Gradual Progress, then\ncompare them both with hexagram number thirty-one, Initiative. What are the\nsimilarities in their ideas? Now look at hexagrams number eleven, seventeen and twentytwo and observe the over-all philosophy which begins to emerge.",

    "1": "Line-1\nLegge: The first line, dynamic, shows the young woman married off in a position ancillary\nto the real wife. It suggests the idea of a person lame in one leg who yet manages to tramp\nalong. Going forward will be fortunate.\nWilhelm/Baynes: The Marrying Maiden as a concubine. A lame man who is able to\ntread. Undertakings bring good fortune.\nBlofeld: The maiden marries and becomes a concubine. The lame can walk -- to advance\nbrings good fortune. [Some advance is indicated, but not a very splendid one. To become\n\na concubine is doubtless better than remaining single; to walk with a limp is better than\nnot walking at all – neither is greatly to be desired.]\nLiu: The marrying maiden is to be a concubine. A crippled man can walk. Undertaking is\ngood fortune. [Even with limited ability a person will achieve his undertakings by\ndepending on someone influential.]\nRitsema/Karcher: Converting Maidenhood using the junior- sister. Halting enabling\ntreading. Chastising significant.\nShaughnessy: The returning maiden with younger sisters; the lame are able to walk; to\nbe upright is auspicious.\nCleary (1): Marrying off a young girl as a junior wife. The lame can walk. It is good to go\non. [The time is not right but her virtue is right, and she does not do anything improper.\nThis represents the ability to maintain rectitude when the time is not right.]\nCleary (2): Marrying a young girl, taking junior wives. The lame can walk. To go on leads\nto good fortune.\nWu: The marrying of a young woman with her younger sister is like treading with one\nlame leg. It is auspicious to proceed.\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: That she is in a subordinate position is the constant practice in such a\ncase. Even though lame she can render useful service. Wilhelm/Baynes: \"The marrying\nmaiden as a concubine,” because that gives duration. \"A lame man who is able to tread...,”\nbecause they receive each other. Blofeld: What is described in the first sentence was due\nto her constancy; the second sentence presages mutual support. Ritsema/Karcher:\nUsing persevering indeed. Mutualizing receiving indeed. Cleary (2): The lame can walk\nto good fortune because of service. Wu: It is auspicious because they have roles to play.\nLegge: A feudal prince was said to marry nine ladies at once. The principal of them was\nthe bride who was to be the proper wife, and she was attended by two others, virgins from\nher father's harem; a cousin and a half-sister, a daughter of her father by another mother\nof inferior rank. Under line one the young woman of the hexagram appears in the inferior\nposition of this half-sister. But the line is dynamic, indicative of a female of firm virtue.\nThe mean condition and its duties are to be deplored, and give the auspice of lameness;\nbut notwithstanding, the secondary wife will in a measure discharge her service. There\nwill be good fortune.\nNotwithstanding apparent disadvantages, an able officer may do his ruler good service. \"It\nis the constant practice for such a case\" in the Confucian commentary seems to mean that\nan ancillary wife has no right to the disposition of herself, but must do what she is told.\nThus it is that the mean position of the younger sister does not interfere with the service\nthat she can render.\n\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: At the outset, the man in a relatively low position enjoys the confidence of the prince.\nOutwardly, he keeps tactfully behind the official ministers. Although this diminishes his\nstatus, he continues to perform valuable services for the state.\nWing: Your position within the situation is low in stature, but you have the good fortune\nof being taken into the confidence of a superior. If you remain Subordinate, you will\nassure your security. You can then influence the situation using tact and reserve.\nEditor: This line does not lend itself to the usual gender designation employed in this\nbook. Generally speaking, the line should be read as symbolic of any situation in which\none is in a subordinate, powerless position. Often it suggests the need for some sort of\ncompromise in the situation at hand.\nIn that game of interaction which the ego plays with the objective psyche, it\nappears as if the cards were dealt by the unconscious, since it is the unconscious\nwhich gives rise to and shapes the strength or weakness of the ego. The ego's\nresponsibility is to do the best that it can with the hand it is dealt.\nE.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest\nA. An image of making do with what you have.

    "2": "Line-2\nLegge: The second line, dynamic, shows her blind of one eye, and yet able to see. There\nwill be advantage in her maintaining the firm correctness of a solitary widow.\nWilhelm/Baynes: A one-eyed man who is able to see. The perseverance of a solitary\nman furthers.\nBlofeld: The one-eyed man can see. Righteous persistence brings advantage to the\nrecluse. [It is not unusual for a one-eyed man to see, more or less, or for a recluse to\nbenefit from persistence in his meditations and devotions; neither of them symbolizes\nanything at all remarkable.]\nLiu: A one-eyed man can see. It benefits the solitary man to keep quiet.\nRitsema/Karcher: Squinting enabling observing. Harvesting: shade people's Trial.\nShaughnessy: The blind are able to see; beneficial for a dark man to determine.\n\nCleary (1): The one-eyed can see. It is beneficial to be chaste as a hermit.\nWu: It is like looking with one injured eye. It is advantageous to having a recluse’s\nperseverance.\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: She has not changed from the constancy proper to a wife.\nWilhelm/Baynes: The permanent law is not changed. Blofeld: As yet, no change\noccurs in the ordinary course of events. Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet transforming the\nrules indeed. Cleary (2): The benefit of the chastity of a hermit is not changing the norm.\nWu: He has not yet deviated from his course.\nLegge: Line two is dynamic in a magnetic place, and her correlate is magnetic in a\ndynamic place. Both, however, are central in their respective trigrams. With a weak\ncorrelate, line two can't do much in the discharge of her duties, but if she thinks only of her\nhusband, like the widow who will die rather than marry again, such devotion will have its\neffect and reward. Though blind in one eye, she still manages to see -- devoted loyalty in\nan officer will compensate for many disadvantages.\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: Devoted loyalty on the part of the man will compensate for many weaknesses on the\npart of his associates as well.\nWing: The situation is disappointing. It is up to you, alone, to carry on the original vision.\nSuch devotion and loyalty will ultimately bring progress.\nEditor: The line does not lend itself to the usual gender designations used in this\nbook. Blofeld's Confucian commentary: \"As yet, no change occurs in the ordinary course\nof events” suggests that although we may not perceive or understand what is going on, we\nstill haven't violated the Work. Legge's rendition of \"the firm correctness of a solitary\nwidow” implies virtuous abstinence -- not giving one's energy to any force that would\ncompromise our integrity.\nIt is high time we realized that it is pointless to praise the light and preach it if\nnobody can see it. It is much more needful to teach people the art of seeing. For it\nis obvious that far too many people are incapable of establishing a connection\nbetween the sacred figures and their own psyche: they cannot see to what extent\nthe equivalent images are lying dormant in their own unconscious. In order to\nfacilitate this inner vision we must first clear the way for the faculty of seeing.\nHow this is to be done without psychology, that is, without making contact with\nthe psyche, is, frankly, beyond my comprehension.\nJung -- Psychology and Alchemy\nA. The situation has yet to clarify -- go it alone until the way becomes clear.\n\nB. Partial vision is better than none. Remain uncommitted, and do not depart from\nyour accustomed routine.",

She returns and accepts an ancillary position.\nWilhelm/Baynes: The Marrying Maiden as a slave. She marries as a concubine.\nBlofeld: From being a servant, the marriageable maiden becomes a concubine.\n[Again, a small advance is made, but nothing very satisfying is won.]\nLiu: The marrying girl is to be a maidservant. She marries as a concubine.\nRitsema/Karcher: Converting Maidenhood: using hair-growing. Reversing\nConverting: using the junior-sister.\nShaughnessy: The returning maiden with consorts turns around and returns with\nyounger sisters.\nCleary (1): When the bride-to-be seeks, it will be the little sister who is married\ninstead.\nWu: The marrying of the young woman is being put on hold. Instead, her younger sister is\nmarried in her place.\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: This is shown by the improprieties indicated in the line. Wilhelm/\nBaynes: She is not yet in the appropriate place. Blofeld: Her former state is indicated by\nthe unsuitable position of this line. Ritsema/Karcher: Not- yet appropriate indeed.\nCleary (2): The bride-to-be who seeks is not right. Wu: Because her position is improper.\nLegge: The third line is magnetic in a dynamic place at the top of the trigram of Frivolity.\nShe is of so mean a character and such a slave of passion that no one will marry her. She\nreturns and accepts the position of a concubine.\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: It is preferable to be a concubine rather than a slave. The inferior person enters into\nsituations incompatible with self-esteem, in pursuit of joys that cannot be attained\nlegitimately.\nWing: To attain your desires, it will be necessary for you to compromise your Self.\n\nEditor: There are at least two interpretations of this line: one portrays moving from an\nabject position (slavery) to accept a correct, albeit still subservient role. On the other hand,\nthe line can suggest an attempt at a union or synthesis which is unstable or premature:\nThe imbalances within the situation cause its dynamics to be re-adjusted at a lower level\nthan desired. An inherent instability cannot be maintained no matter how much we want\nit to be otherwise.\nThose who do not seek release from the bondage of the instinctive drives by the\nroad of inner development remain the slaves of their own passionate desirousness\nor suffer the sterility resulting from its ruthless repression.

    "4": "Line-4\nLegge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows the young woman who is to be married off\nprotracting the time. She may be late in being married, but the time will come.\nWilhelm/Baynes: The Marrying Maiden draws out the allotted time. A late marriage\ncomes in due course.\nBlofeld: The maiden stays unwed beyond the proper time, but the day comes when she\nmakes a late marriage.\nLiu: The marrying girl postpones marriage. She will marry later, waiting for the right\ntime.\nRitsema/Karcher: Converting Maidenhood overrunning the term. Procrastinating\nConverting possesses the season.\nShaughnessy: The returning maiden exceeds the appointed time, and tardily returns\nhaving time.\nCleary (1): When it is the wrong time for a girl to marry, she delays the marriage until the\nproper time.\nWu: The marrying of the young woman is postponed. A later date is anticipated.\n\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: After waiting, the thing may be done all the better. Wilhelm/\nBaynes: The state of mind that leads to drawing out of the allotted time indicates a desire\nto wait for something before going. Blofeld: Her firm desire to postpone her marriage\nindicates that we should wait before taking action. Ritsema/Karcher: Over-running the\nterm's purpose. Possessing awaiting and-also moving indeed. Cleary (2): The purpose of\nputting off the marriage is to go at the right time. Wu: To wait for the right time.\nLegge: Line four is dynamic, where it should be magnetic, but in the case of a female the\nindication is not bad. The subject of the line, however, is in no haste. She waits, and the\ngood time will come. It is she who puts off the marriage, not the other way around.\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: The person does not throw her virtue away but waits. Her marriage will be all the\nbetter for it.\nWing: You are faced with a situation in which you must now refrain from action in order\nto await a more propitious time. It may appear that the world is passing you by as you wait,\nbut your reward for maintaining your principles is on its way.\nEditor: The line does not lend itself to the usual gender designations used in this book.\nThe image is one of patient postponement, with assurance that the desired consequences\nwill occur in the course of time. Wilhelm's rendition of \"allotted time” suggests that fate is\ninvolved.\nIn the early community, the man who had learned to bide his time, for either\nrevenge, barter, or any other objective, also had the advantage over the one who\nwas compelled to act when the stimulus arose, without consideration of the\nconsequences. Through having disciplined his own instincts such a man gained\npower over his more instinctively acting neighbors. The power of the medicine\nman rested largely on such self-control.\nM.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy\nA. Be patient -- a union comes in the course of time.\nB. Wait and see. Don't commit yourself -- it will all make sense eventually.",
    "5": "Line-5\nLegge: The fifth line, magnetic, reminds us of the marrying of the younger sister of King\nTi-yi, when the sleeves of the princess were not equal to those of the still younger sister\nwho accompanied her in an inferior capacity. The case suggests the thought of the moon\nalmost full. There will be good fortune.\n\nWilhelm/Baynes: The sovereign I gave his daughter in marriage. The embroidered\ngarments of the princess were not as gorgeous as those of the serving maid. The moon\nthat is nearly full brings good fortune.\nBlofeld: The Emperor's second marriageable daughter wore regal garments less splendid\nthat those of her bridesmaid. [The implication is that the princess showed better taste\nthan her maid in not dressing too grandly. We must be on our guard against\nostentation.] Close upon the full moon comes good fortune!\nLiu: Emperor I gives his daughter in marriage. The embroidered dress of the princess is\nnot as splendid as that of the concubine. The moon is nearly full. Good fortune.\nRitsema/Karcher: The supreme burgeoning Converting Maidenhood. One's chief's\nsleeves: One's junior-sister's sleeves not thus fine. The moon almost facing, significant.\nShaughnessy: Di Yi marries off the maiden: the primary wife's sleeves are not as fine as\nher younger sister's sleeves; the day's moon is past full; auspicious.\nCleary (1): The emperor marries off his younger sister; the attire of the empress is not as\ngood as the attire of the young wife. The moon is nearly full. Good fortune.\nCleary (2): ... The attire of the lady is not as good as that of the junior wives. The moon is\nalmost full. This is auspicious.\nWu: Di Yi married off his younger sister. Her dress was not so elaborate as her younger\nsister’s. The moon was almost full. Auspicious. [This was considered proper, for what was\nproper was the virtuous union, not the wedding dress.]\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: That her sleeves were not equal to her inferior's shows her noble\ncharacter, indicated by the central position of the line. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is in\nthe middle, hence action has value. Blofeld: The first sentence means that, though we\nmay be of only middle rank, we should behave with true nobility. Ritsema/Karcher:\nOne's situation located-in the center. Using valuing movement indeed. Cleary (2): The\nposition is one of balance, behaving in a noble manner. Wu: Her position was central and\nroyal. She had no need for ornamentations.\nLegge: The King's sister is here honorably married, suggesting that the adornment she\npreferred was the \"ornament of the hidden man of the heart.” Ch'eng-tzu says: \"The\nmoon is not full, but only nearly full. A wife ought not to eclipse her husband.” She is in\nthe place of honor, with a proper correlate in line two.\n\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: The man is reminded that the sister of King I placed herself graciously below her\noutranked husband and remained free of vanity. The moon that is full does not face the\nsun.\nWing: When you can overlook your social position and stature and place yourself in the\nservice of another, you will realize good fortune. To accomplish this you must overcome\nvanity, pride, and any ostentatious behavior. To Subordinate yourself to others,\nregardless of their position, is now a good thing.\nEditor: It is instructive to compare this line with the fifth line of hexagram number eleven,\nHarmony, which also refers to King Ti-yi's younger sister. A clue to the symbolism\ncomes from the Neo-Confucian classic, The Doctrine of the Mean:\nThe Book of Odes says, \"Over her brocaded robe, she wore a plain and simple\ndress,” for she disliked the loudness of its color and patterns. Thus the way of the\nsuperior man is hidden but becomes more prominent every day, whereas the way\nof the inferior man is conspicuous but gradually disappears. It is characteristic of\nthe superior man to be plain, and yet people do not get tired of him. He is simple\nand yet rich in cultural adornment. He is amiable and yet systematically\nmethodical. He knows what is distant begins with what is near. He knows where\nthe winds (moral influence) come from. And he knows the subtle will be\nmanifested. Such a man can enter into virtue.\nWe see here a princess-bride who is less attractively arrayed than her bridesmaid,\nand a waxing moon which has yet to reach full illumination. The context of the line is a\nroyal marriage -- the hieros gamos or holy marriage of the alchemists which is also\ndescribed in hexagram number eleven. Psychologically, the image can suggest that during\na time when forces are coming together for synthesis, less important elements in the\nsituation may seem more attractive than the true essence. Since the moon isn't full yet, we\nhaven't seen all of the light -- full comprehension has yet to dawn. Sometimes the line\nsimply boils down to the idea that \"things are\nnot what they seem.”\nIt should also be pointed out that the reaching up into the realm of the superconscious and its exploration, while approaching the consciousness of the Self,\nmay sometimes even constitute an obstacle to full Self- realization, to the reaching\nof the summit where the personal-I awareness blends into awareness of the\nspiritual Self. One can become so fascinated by the wonders of the superconscious realm, so absorbed in it, so identified with some of its special aspects or\nmanifestations as to lose or paralyze the urge to reach the summit of Selfrealization.\nRoberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis\nA. \"You can't see the forest for the trees.\" The truth is hidden by distracting\nelements, but in the fullness of time it will be revealed.

Wu: The\ntop line does not have anything substantial to offer, because she carries a bottomless\nbasket.\nLegge: The sixth line is magnetic at the top of the hexagram, and without a proper\ncorrelate, hence the unfortunate auspice.
