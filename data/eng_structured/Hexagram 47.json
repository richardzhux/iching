  "gua": "Judgment\nLegge: Oppression means that successful progress is still possible. The perseverance of\nthe truly great man brings good fortune without error; but if he relies on words, no one\nwill believe them.\nWilhelm/Baynes: Oppression. Success. Perseverance. The great man brings about\ngood fortune. No blame. When one has something to say, it is not believed.\nBlofeld: Adversity leading to success thanks to persistence in a righteous course; good\nfortune for the truly great and freedom from error! Though words be spoken, they will not\ninspire confidence. [`Great' refers to high moral qualities. This hexagram is of evil omen\nfor most people, but success can be won through tremendous persistence in doing what is\nright.]\nLiu: Oppression. Success. Persistence. Good fortune for the great man. No blame. If one\nindicates with words only, no one will believe.\nRitsema/Karcher: Confining, Growing. Trial: Great People significant. Without fault.\nPossessing words not trustworthy. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of\nrestriction and distress. It emphasizes that turning inward through accepting enclosure\nis the adequate way to handle it...]\nShaughnessy: Entangled: Receipt; determination for the great man is auspicious;\nthere is no trouble. There are words that are not trustworthy.\nCleary (1): Exhaustion develops the righteous. Great people are fortunate and\nblameless. If one complains, one will not be trusted.\nCleary (2): Exhausted but coming through successfully, upright great people are\nfortunate and impeccable. Mere words are not believed.\nWu: Hardship indicates pervasion and perseverance. There will be good fortune for the\ngreat men. No error. But their words do not make impressions on people.\n\nThe Image\nLegge: An abyss beneath the marsh that drains its water -- the image of Oppression.\nThus the superior man will sacrifice his life to attain his purpose.\nWilhelm/Baynes: There is no water in the lake: the image of Exhaustion. Thus the\nsuperior man stakes his life on following his will.\nBlofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a marsh in which no water (appears). The Superior\nMan risks his life to carry out his will.\nLiu: The lake with no water symbolizes Oppression. The superior man would give up\nhis life to achieve his purpose.\nRitsema/Karcher: Marsh without stream. Confining. A chun tzu uses involving fate to\nrelease purpose.\nCleary (1): A lake with no water is exhausted. Therefore superior people use life to the\nfull and achieve their aim. [When people lack purpose their path is at an end. Therefore\nthey use life to the full to achieve their aim… Using life to the full means to get to the end\nof conditioned life; achieving one’s aim means to achieve the primordial life… Using the\ntemporal to restore the primordial, ending false life and establishing real life, producing\nbeing in the midst of nothingness, seeking life within death, getting through an\nexhausting impasse, is like a lake without water again being filled with water.]\nCleary (2): …Developed people accomplish their will by living out their destiny.\n[Developed people only live out their destiny; they do not willingly try to avoid following\nand accepting it. Being strong and balanced, they are able to be joyful even in danger;\nthis is the will that is up to oneself. Developed people intend to accomplish their will and\ndo not vacillate just because they run into problems.]\nWu: The marsh has no water; this is Hardship. Thus the jun zi is prepared to dedicate\nhis life to fulfill his commitments. [A marsh devoid of water is like a man deprived of his\nintellectual pursuits. This is unacceptable to a jun zi. He would rather fight to the end\nthan surrender to idiocy.]\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: In Oppression we see the dynamic lines covered and obscured by\nthe magnetic. We see the attribute of Perilousness in the lower trigram going on to\nCheerfulness in the upper. Who but the superior man is still able to advance although\nstraitened by circumstances? The central position of the dynamic lines explains the good\nfortune of the great man who is firm and correct. As regards speech making, to be fond of\nargument or persuasion is the way to be reduced to extremity.\nLegge: The written Chinese character of Oppression presents us with the picture of a\ntree within an enclosure. \"A plant,\" according to Williams, \"fading for want of room.\" \"A\n\ntree,\" according to T'ai Tung, \"not allowed to spread its branches.\" The image conveys the\nidea of being straitened and distressed, and the hexagram indicates how skilful\nmanagement may relieve it.\nThe two central places in the figure are occupied by dynamic lines, but line two is\nconfined between one and three, which are magnetic; and line five (the ruler), as well as\nfour (his minister), are covered by the magnetic sixth line. These conditions indicate the\nrepression of good men by adversity. The K'ang-hsi editors imply that \"actions and not\nwords\" are what are required in the case.\nPerilousness is the attribute of the lower trigram, and Cheerfulness that of the\nupper. The superior man, no matter how straitened, remains master of himself, and\npursues his principled intent. The idea of speech making is found in the upper trigram,\none of the attributes of which is the mouth, or speech, as well as Pleased Satisfaction. The\npleading of the oppressed party still tries to make others pleased with him.\nLiterally translated, the first sentence of the Image reads: \"A marsh with no water\nis Oppression.\" Chu Hsi says: \"The water descending and leaking away, the marsh above\nwill become dry.\"\nAnthony: Our belief in the ruling power as beneficial is shaken by doubt. This lack of\nsteadfastness is a problem because it obstructs acceptance and its corrective power. We\noften receive this hexagram when we feel tired. The oppressiveness of doubt exhausts our\ninner resources.\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nJudgment: With enough will, success can be won. \"Actions speak louder than words.”\n(i.e., The answer lies beyond the realm of reason and logic -- intuition furthers.)\nThe Superior Man stakes everything he's got on his will to succeed.\nIn Oppression we have the image of a dry lake bed. Anyone who has ever seen\nalkali flats in the desert can easily understand this metaphor for Oppression -- almost\nnothing can live in such an environment. The following hexagram, The Well, is an\nupside-down image of Oppression depicting the opposite case of an unending source of\nnourishment flowing from deep beneath the surface of the earth. (A comparison of these\ntwo figures will reveal a great deal about the meaning of each.)\nTo be under Oppression then, is to be cut off from all sustenance -- although there\nis water down below, it is presently inaccessible, and there is no nourishing flow of inner\nforces to the surface. This is a common, inevitable and potentially defeating experience for\nanyone doing serious inner work:\nPeople who try to practice the Tao can all keep steadfast when they are in easy\ncircumstances, but many of them waver in determination when they are in\ndifficult or perilous situations. They may change their minds because of the\n\npressures of making a living, or they may slack in determination due to illness;\ntheir spirits may flag because of old age, or they may stop work because of\nobstruction by some obsession. All these are cases in which people do not exert the\nmind of Tao and are hindered by exhaustion, so they ultimately do not attain the\nTao.\nT. Cleary – The Taoist I Ching\nObviously, this is a dangerous situation, and we are told how to cope with it in the\nConfucian commentary, where it is observed that the lower trigram of Peril goes on to the\nupper trigram of Cheerfulness. These two trigrams are found in reversed sequence in\nhexagram number sixty, Restrictive Regulations, where a cheerful attitude is\ndescribed as absolutely essential for the furtherance of the Work. The observations made\nthere also apply here, and we see the superior man thereby enabled to advance under\nconditions that would utterly defeat lesser individuals.\nThis Cheerfulness cannot be underestimated. When it comes naturally and isn't\nforced, it is a gift of grace. Suddenly one is enabled to face the most incredible hardships\nwith a light heart. It isn't that you no longer care -- you still do the best you can to further\nthe Work, but you do it with bemused detachment.\nThe one thing the Jewish mystics never lost sight of was the suffering experienced\nin the arena of the profane. They did not retreat from this suffering, but sought\ninstead to find meaning in it by living it. This is the core of mysticism. The temple\nin which the sacred marriage takes place is the world.\nC. Ponce -- Kabbalah\nLines 2 and 5 specifically mention sacrifice: an important concept in the I Ching.\nSacrifice is mentioned in lines 17:6, 45:2, 46:2, 46:4, 47:2, 47:5, 63:5, and in the Judgment\nof hexagram 20. Note that in each case sincerity is specifically cited as essential to success.\nSincere 1: marked by genuineness: as a: free of dissimulation: not hypocritical:\nREAL, TRUE, HONEST...\nVery often, the “sincerity” of our sacrifices involves following the dictates of the\nWork whether we fully understand them or not. Much that takes place in the Work is\nincomprehensible to ego consciousness; for example, changes often occur within the\npsyche which we only experience as strange dreams. Yet somehow, perhaps months later,\nwe suddenly realize that we no longer act in a certain way or have lost interest in\nsomething that used to be of compelling importance. Our sacrifices are necessary for these\nchanges to take place, even if they don't immediately make sense to us.\n\"With sacrifice shall you nourish the gods; and may the gods nourish you. Thus\nnourishing one another, you will obtain the Highest Good. \"The gods, nourished\nby sacrifice, will bestow on you the enjoyments you desire.\" He is verily a thief\nwho enjoys the things that they give without offering to them anything in return.\nThe Bhagavad-Gita\n\nEach of Cleary’s Taoist (1) and Buddhist (2) commentaries provides valuable\ninsights into how much courage is required to follow the dictates of the Work at its more\nadvanced levels. Take comfort that others before you have persevered and survived:\n“Developed people accomplish their will by living out their destiny.”",
  "lines": {
    "1": "Line-1\nLegge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject with bare buttocks straitened under\nthe stump of a tree. She enters a dark valley, and for three years has no prospect of\ndeliverance.\nWilhelm/Baynes: One sits oppressed under a bare tree and strays into a gloomy valley.\nFor three years one sees nothing.\nBlofeld: With dried branches entangling the lower part of his body, he enters a gloomy\nvalley. For three years he encounters no one. [Whoever receives this line must resign\nhimself to failure.]\nLiu: His bottom is oppressed by the bare tree. He enters a dark valley. For three years, he\nsees no one. [This line indicates fear, sadness or mourning.]\nRitsema/Karcher: The sacrum Confined, tending-towards stump wood. Entering\ntending-towards a shady gully. Three year's- time not encountering.\nShaughnessy: The lips are entangled in a columnar tree: Entering into a dark valley, for\nthree years he is not drawn out; inauspicious.\nCleary (1): Sitting exhausted on a tree stump, gone into a dark ravine, not to be seen for\nthree years.\nWu: He sits on tree roots. He enters a lonely valley. He does not see the outside world for\nthree years. [It is all in his mind. (He) is preoccupied with the thoughts of hardship before\nit actually happens.]\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: So benighted is she, and without clear vision. Wilhelm/Baynes:\nOne is gloomy and not clear. Blofeld: What is said about entering a gloomy valley\nindicates darkness that will not be dispelled. Ritsema/Karcher: Shady, not bright\nindeed. Cleary (2): It is obscure and unclear. Wu: His mind is not open.\nLegge: The poor subject of line one sitting on a mere stump, which affords her no shelter,\nis indeed badly off. The line is at the bottom of the trigram of Peril, and her correlate\nfourth line is unable to render help. So stupid is line one that by her own action she\nincreases her distress. \"Three years\" is used for a long time.\n\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: At the outset, the man lacks clear vision and is badly off. He is overwhelmed and has\nno immediate prospects of deliverance.\nWing: You are in danger of falling into a trap created by an adverse situation. The trap is\nof your own making and comes about because of discouragement. Discouragement creates\na pattern for failure that will continue if not halted now.\nAnthony: As long as we are influenced by doubt, we are blocked from seeing the solution.\nWe must firmly resist doubt and hopelessness to restore open-mindedness. The way out\nwill show itself at the right time.\nEditor: Despite Blofeld's note on this line, it does not necessarily always intimate\ncomplete failure. In the most neutral sense, it's an image of stalemate, though there is a\ndefinite suggestion that this is due to one's own failing in something. Self-pity is hinted at,\nas well as lack of clarity. Some kind of illusion prevails. There is a possibility that things\naren't as bad as they seem, or your attitude is making them worse than they need to be.\nThe line can sometimes indicate that you have misunderstood a previous hexagram.\nThere are two wrongs the soul commits. The first is its descent; the second, the\nevil done after arrival here below. The first is punished by the very conditions of\nits descent. Punishment for the second is passage once more into other bodies,\nthere to remain at greater or less length according to the judgment of its deserts.\n(The word \"judgment\" indicates that this takes place as a result of divine law.) If,\nhowever, its perversity goes beyond all measure, the soul incurs an even more\nsevere penalty administered by avenging daimons.\nPlotinus -- The Enneads\nA. You are oppressed and confined by ignorance; perhaps the aridity of \"reason.\"\nB. A self-created impasse.",
    "2": "Line-2\nLegge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject straitened amidst his wine and viands.\nThere come to him anon the red knee-covers of the ruler. It will be well for him to\nmaintain his sincerity as in sacrificing. Active operations on his part will lead to evil, but\nhe will be free from blame.\nWilhelm/Baynes: One is oppressed while at meat and drink. The man with the scarlet\nknee bands is just coming. It furthers one to offer sacrifice. To set forth brings misfortune.\nNo blame. [This pictures a state of inner oppression. Externally, all is well, one has meat\nand drink. But one is exhausted by the commonplaces of life, and there seems to be no\nway of escape. Then help comes from a high place… Here a disagreeable situation must\nbe overcome by patience of spirit.]\n\nBlofeld: Difficulties arise through indulgence in food and drink. A vermillion sashwearer (man of very high rank) appears; it is advisable to utilize this opportunity to offer\nsacrifice. Advancing brings misfortune, though no error is involved.\nLiu: Oppressed by food and drink. The man in the red ceremonial robe comes. It is\nbeneficial to sacrifice. It leads to misfortune to set forth. No blame.\nRitsema/Karcher: Confined, tending-towards liquor taking-in. Scarlet sashes on-allsides coming. Harvesting: availing-of presenting oblations. Chastising: pitfall, without\nfault.\nShaughnessy: Entangled in wine and food: the scarlet kneepads having just arrived, it is\nbeneficial to use an aromatic grass sacrifice; to be upright is inauspicious; there is no\ntrouble.\nCleary (1): Hard up for wine and food; then comes the regal robe. It is beneficial to make\nceremonial offerings. To go on an expedition brings misfortune. No blame.\nCleary (2): Exhausted, but with food and drink. When the regal robe comes, it is\nbeneficial to make a ceremonial offering. An expedition leads to misfortune, but there is no\nblame.\nWu: He is enslaved by wine and food. He just received a red vestment. It is good for\nmaking offerings. He will encounter ill fortune in having undertakings, but no error.\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: Although straitened, his position is central, and there will be ground\nfor congratulation. Wilhelm/Baynes: The middle brings blessing. Blofeld: The\ndifficulties arising from our gluttony may nevertheless be productive of blessings.\nRitsema/Karcher: Center possessing reward indeed. Cleary (2): There is celebration\nwithin. Wu: The central position has things worthy of celebration.\nLegge: The three dynamic lines in the figure (two, four and five) are all superior men, and\ntheir being straitened is not in themselves, but in their circumstances which prevent selfdevelopment. Hence line two is straitened while he fares sumptuously. His correlate in\nthe fifth place, though not quite proper, is the ruler who comes to his help. (The red knee\ncovers distinguish the ruler from those of the nobles, which are scarlet.) Let line two\ncultivate his sincerity and do the work of the hexagram as if he were sacrificing to spiritual\nbeings, and then, if he keeps quiet, all will be well.\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: The man is apparently well off but is actually inwardly depressed. He is unable to\nsolve the ordinary problems of life and develop his basic principles. He is rescued by the\n\nprince, who is looking for able helpers. However, he must first be patient until the unseen\nobstacles are overcome by prayers and sacrifices.\nWing: An Adversity facing you now comes about from boredom. Indulgences and\npleasures may come too easily for you. Try giving yourself to a worthwhile cause. There is\nredemption in such altruistic actions.\nEditor: The core idea here is that a sacrifice of some kind is necessary to relieve your\noppression. Sacrifice is a universal principle deeply rooted in the unconscious psyche. The\ngeneral idea behind it is the offering of something valuable to obtain something more\nvaluable, which may not be immediately obvious; it is an act of faith and acknowledgment\nof subservience to higher guidance. In terms of the Work, this is the ego's sacrifice of its\nautonomy to the Self. Here the situation is the seeming contradiction of being oppressed\nwhile surrounded by plenty, so the sacrifice could involve not partaking of what is readily\navailable. Compare with 45:2, which is created if this is the only changing line.\nSacrifice, \"making sacred\" (from the Latin sacrum facere) psychologically entails\na surrender of ego libido to the service and intents of the transpersonal\nentelechy ... Transformation rests on sacrifice, on making \"holy\" by giving up\nand rendering to the transpersonal, \"sacred\" powers what one \"has\" while\nremaining what one essentially \"is.\" One submits to change, death and loss of\nsome aspects of one's being, abilities or possessions, while refusing to \"curse God,\nand die\" (Job 2:9), in other words, refusing to let go of one's trust in life and one's\ncentral core of integrity and Self.\nE.C. Whitmont -- The Alchemy of Healing\nA. Starving amid plenty, one has almost made a connection with the source of truth.\nGive up your illusions and wait.\nB. What you seek is all around you, and the connection is immanent. Have the will\nto sacrifice an option to relieve your oppression.\nC. You can afford to sacrifice something now in the faith that you'll get something\nbetter later on.",
    "3": "Line-3\nLegge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject straitened before a frowning rock. He\nlays hold of thorns. He enters his palace, and does not see his wife. There will be evil.\nWilhelm/Baynes: A man permits himself to be oppressed by stone, and leans on thorns\nand thistles. He enters his house and does not see his wife. Misfortune.\nBlofeld: Faced by rock-like difficulties and with naught to lean upon but thistles and\nbriars, he entered his dwelling but could not find his wife -- misfortune! [This line may be\n\ntaken to presage insuperable difficulties; the word “wife\" does not necessarily have any\nspecial application to our case, as can be seen from the commentary on the line.]\nLiu: The man is oppressed by stone. He sits on thorns and thistles. When he enters his\nhome, he cannot find his wife. Misfortune. [One should be prepared to meet with insult or\ndifficulty.]\nRitsema/Karcher: Confined, tending-toward petrification. Seizing tending-towards star\nthistles. Entering tending- towards one's house. Not visualizing one's consort. Pitfall.\nShaughnessy: Entangled in stone, and crying out in the thistles: Entering into his palace,\nand not seeing his wife; inauspicious.\nCleary (1): Stymied by rocks, resting on thorns, going into the house without seeing the\nwife – inauspicious.\nCleary (2): Exhausted on a rock, resting on thorns, going into a house but not seeing the\nwife is not a good sign.\nWu: He is surrounded by rocks and leaning on thorny shrubs. He enters his house and\ndoes not find his wife. Foreboding.\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: \"He lays hold of thorns\" -- this is suggested by the position of the line\nabove the dynamic line. To enter one's palace and not see one's wife is inauspicious.\nWilhelm/Baynes: He rests on a hard line. This bodes misfortune. Blofeld: The firm\nline just below him. His not finding his wife symbolizes bad luck. Ritsema/Karcher:\nRiding a solid indeed. Not auspicious indeed. Cleary (2): Not seeing the wife is not a\ngood sign. Wu: An unfortunate omen.\nLegge: For a full explanation of the third line, Chu Hsi refers the reader to what Confucius\nsaid on it: \"If one be distressed by what need not distress him, his name is sure to be\ndisgraced; if he lay hold on what he should not touch, his life is sure to be imperiled. In\ndisgrace and danger, his death will soon come; is it possible for him in such\ncircumstances to see his wife?\" The K'ang-hsi editors say here: \"The subjects of the three\nmagnetic lines (one, three and six) are all unable to cope correctly with the oppression of\ntheir circumstances. The first is at the bottom, sitting and distressed. The third line, able\neither to advance or retreat, advances and is distressed. Wounded abroad, he returns to\nhis family and finds no one to receive him: a graphic portrayal of the results of reckless\naction.\"\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: The man is indecisively unable to deal with adversity and is oppressed by something\nwhich should not oppress him. He leans on things like thorns and thistles, which are\nhazardous yet cannot support him.\n\nWing: You allow yourself to become oppressed by things that are not oppressive.\nYou put your faith in things that cannot support you. You are unable to see your priorities\nalthough they are obvious. This brings misfortune.\nEditor: This line does not lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. The rock is often a\nsymbol of eternity, and is seen as a dwelling place for spiritual beings, hence: a\ntranscendental reality or \"eternal verity.\" In fairy tales a barrier of thorns is often created\nby an evil witch or other negative magnetic force -- the feminine principle in its destructive\naspect. This barrier is usually what separates the hero from the sleeping maiden, his\nunconscious anima or feminine soul. A house or palace is the whole psyche. (\"In my\nfather's house are many mansions.\" -- John 14:2) The wife of course, is the contra-sexual\ncorrelate: in a man, the anima, or emotional-feeling component of his psyche. (A woman\nreceiving this line should just reverse the symbolism and see it as the animus, or logicalthinking component of her psyche.) Putting all these symbols together we receive an\nimage of a situation which is somehow contrary to \"the laws of nature.\" Both the frowning\nrock (yang) and the thorns (yin) are opposed to the situation, so no union can possibly\ntake place: \"He does not see his wife.\" If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram\ncreated is number twenty-eight, Critical Mass, with a corresponding line which\nindicates a position of extreme vulnerability to danger. This line is an unambiguous\nwarning that your situation is untenable -- both dynamic and magnetic forces are against\nyou. Ritsema/Karcher translate \"pitfall\" as: \"Leads away from the experience of\nmeaning; stuck and exposed to danger, unable to take in the situation; flow of life and\nspirit is blocked...\" Wilhelm alludes to \"immanent death,\" which, of course, should be\ninterpreted symbolically in most cases.\nHe disowned the God who made him, dishonored the Rock, his salvation.\nDeuteronomy 32: 15\nA. You are out of touch with reality -- resisting a situation that you should accept.\nB. Your ego-indulgence in illusion prevents psychic unity; your action, intention or\nattitude is in opposition to psychic unification.",
    "4": "Line-4\nLegge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject proceeding very slowly to help\nthe subject of the first line, who is straitened by the carriage adorned with metal in\nfront of him. There will be occasion for regret, but the end will be good.\nWilhelm/Baynes: He comes very quietly, oppressed in a golden carriage. Humiliation,\nbut the end is reached.\nBlofeld: A slow arrival. Trouble in a golden carriage. Shame, but not for long. [Trouble in\na golden carriage coupled with shame suggests that we get into difficulty through our\n\npresumption, or through placing too much confidence in someone of much higher station\nthan ourselves.]\nLiu: He comes slowly, oppressed in a golden carriage. Embarrassment, but good results\nin the end.\nRitsema/Karcher: Coming, ambling, ambling. Confined, tending-towards a metallic\nchariot. Abashment. Possessing completion.\nShaughnessy: Coming slowly, entangled in the metal chariot; distress; there is an end.\nCleary (1): Coming gradually, exhausted in a golden cart; shame has an end.\nCleary (2): Coming slowly, exhausted in a gold car, there is shame, but there is a\nconclusion.\nWu: Walking slowly and leisurely, he is distressed in seeing a golden carriage and feels\nhumiliated, but he will complete his assignments.\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: His aim is directed to help the lower line. Although he is not in his\nappropriate place, he and his correlate will in the end be together. Wilhelm/ Baynes:\nHis will is directed downward. Though the place is not appropriate, he nevertheless has\ncompanions. Blofeld: The tardy arrival implies that our will-power is at a low ebb.\nHowever, though the line is not suitably placed, it does not stand alone. [At least we may\nhope for a little aid from others.] Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose located below indeed.\nAlthough not an appropriate situation, possessing associating indeed. Cleary (2): The\nmind is on something lower. There is a partner. Wu: He wishes to be with the one below.\nHe is responsive to the other.\nLegge: Lines four and one are proper correlates, but four is dynamic in a magnetic\nplace and therefore slow to give assistance. Then line one is run over by line two, which is\nrepresented as a chariot of metal. It is difficult for one and four to come together and\neffect much, but four is near the ruler, also dynamic, and through this common sympathy\na measure of success is attained.\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: The man in a high position proceeds hesitantly to help the lower class. He\nencounters difficulty in breaking loose from the circle of the wealthy and the powerful. The\noriginal intention of his good resolution eventually brings favorable results.\nWing: Your progress is slowed by your position in the situation. Although your intentions\nare good, you are diverted from your path by temptations. There is some humiliation, but\nyou will accomplish your aim.\n\nEditor: Most translations render this line as a golden carriage (a luxurious vehicle),\nslowly transporting the subject of the fourth line to his destination. The implication is that\nour unhurried progress may be due to self-indulgence, but the position is not totally\nimproper and a delayed relief of oppression is assured.\nIn each of us there is another whom we do not know. He speaks to us in dreams\nand tells us how differently he sees us from the way we see ourselves.

    "5": "Line-5\nLegge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject with his nose and feet cut off. He\nis straitened by his ministers in their scarlet knee covers. He is leisurely in his movements\nhowever, and is satisfied. It will be well for him to be as sincere as in sacrificing to\nspiritual beings.\nWilhelm/Baynes: His nose and feet are cut off. Oppression at the hands of the man\nwith the purple knee bands. Joy comes softly. It furthers one to make offerings and\nlibations.\nBlofeld: His nose and feet are chopped off owing to difficulties with a vermillion sashwearer (man of high rank), but joy may come in time. It is advisable to offer sacrifice. [It is\nvery sure that we shall have to suffer bitterly. The joy to come is less certain, but may be\nassured by our making a suitable sacrifice.]\nLiu: His nose and feet suffer punishment, oppressed by the man in the red ceremonial\nrobe. Joy comes gradually. It is beneficial to sacrifice.\nRitsema/Karcher: Nose-cutting, foot-cutting. Confined, tending-towards a crimson\nsash. Thereupon ambling possesses stimulating. Harvesting: availing-of offering oblations.\nShaughnessy: Doubled rafters; entangled in crimson kneepads, then slowly having\nextrication; beneficial to use an aromatic grass sacrifice.\nCleary (1): Nose and feet cut off, at an impasse in minister’s garb, gradually there will be\njoy; it is beneficial to make ceremonial offerings.\nCleary (2): Nose and feet cut off, exhausted in a regal robe, etc.\n\nWu: He feels as if his nose and feet had been cut off, as he is distressed in seeing the red\nvestment. He will come out of hardship slowly and be happy. It will be good to make\nofferings.\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: His aim has not yet been gained. Satisfied leisure means his position\nis central and his virtue is correct. Sincere sacrifice means he thereby receives blessing.\nWilhelm/Baynes: He does not yet attain his will. The line is straight and central. Thus\none attains good fortune. Blofeld: What we will now will not come to pass. The correct\nposition of the line. Sacrifice in order to ensure good fortune. Ritsema/Karcher:\nPurpose not yet acquired indeed. Using centering straightening indeed. Acquiescing-in\nblessing indeed. Cleary (2): The aim is not yet attained. Taking a balanced course. One\nreceives blessings. Wu: His wishes have not been fulfilled. He is straightforward. He will\nreceive blessings.\nLegge: The fifth line is repressed by the sixth, yet urged on by the fourth. He is thus\nwounded from above and below, especially the minister in the fourth line with his scarlet\nknee covers. But the upper trigram symbolizes Cheerfulness, and this indicates that he\ngets by notwithstanding his difficulties. His sincerity helps get him through also.\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: The man's good intentions to help mankind are obstructed from above and below,\nespecially by the bureaucrats. Gradually the situation improves. In the meantime, all he\ncan do is to maintain inner composure, as in offering sacrifices to heaven.\nWing: There exists a frustrating lack of information within your milieu. Bureaucracy\nstands in the way of progress. Those who need help are stranded. All you can do is\nmaintain your composure until things take a promised turn for the better.\nEditor: The situation of line five is \"between a rock and a hard place.\" The nose\nsymbolizes intuition -- to have the nose cut off suggests that we have no insight into our\nsituation; when our feet are cut off, we \"don't have a leg to stand on\" and our foundation is\nundermined. Psychologically, the symbolism implies that the stress of the position is\ncaused by a higher power: the Self; if so, the stress is necessary to effect an inner\ntransformation of some sort. We are asked to sacrifice our need to understand the\nincomprehensible and submit to the requirements of the time. This line changes the\nhexagram to number forty, Liberation, suggesting that through submission to\nOppression one eventually attains freedom.\nThe death of the physical body is one of the supremer forms of the principle of\nCrucifixion. One which equals it is the \"death of initiation.\" This is the\ncomparatively high initiation where the whole life is dedicated to the service of\nthe Spirit ... and the initiate instead of dying for a principle, lives out his life in\n\naccordance with a principle, and this can be a far harder thing ... The Great Work\ncomes first, whatever the cost.\nGareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism\nA. Without intuition you have no power-base -- submit to the lessons that a\nrestricted situation offers you. Sacrifice your ego impulses.\nB. You are oppressed by powers outside of your awareness. For the benefit of the\nWork, sacrifice your autonomy and your need to understand, and attain eventual\nliberation.",
    "6": "Line-6\nLegge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject straitened, as if bound with creepers; or\nin a high and dangerous position, and saying to herself: \"If I move, I shall repent it.\" If she\ndoes repent of former errors, there will be good fortune in her going forward.\nWilhelm/Baynes: He is oppressed by creeping vines. He moves uncertainly and says,\n\"Movement brings remorse.\" If one feels remorse over this, and makes a start, good\nfortune comes. [A man is oppressed by bonds that can easily be broken. The distress is\ndrawing to an end. But he is still irresolute; he is still influenced by the previous\nconditions and fears that he may have cause for regret if he makes a move. But as soon\nas he grasps the situation, changes his mental attitude, and makes a firm decision, he\nmasters oppression.]\nBlofeld: Entangled with creepers and tottering uneasily, he voices regret for his actions.\nProvided regret is felt, to advance will bring good fortune. [We shall certainly suffer, but\nsincere regret will stand us in good stead.]\nLiu: Oppressed by vines, he moves uneasily and says, \"Movement brings regret.\" If he\nfeels regret, then sets forth -- good fortune.\nRitsema/Karcher: Confined, tending-towards trailing creepers. Tending-towards the\nunsteady [and] unsettled. Spoken-thus: stirring-up repenting possesses repenting.\nChastising significant.\nShaughnessy: Entangled in the creeping vines in the doubled rafters. Say \"regretting the\nlevel;\" there is regret; determination is auspicious.\nCleary (1): Exhausted at an impasse, in distress, is called regret over action; there is\nregret. It is auspicious to go on an expedition.\nCleary (2): Exhausted in difficulty, in distress, thinking there will be regret if one acts,\none does regret. Going forth leads to good fortune. [At the extreme of Exhaustion, one\nshould go on actively. If one is negative, weak, and feeble in ability, one doubts whether\none’s ideas are right; this is like being tangled up and ill at ease. Fearing that if one acts\n\none will regret it, one always shrinks back, regrettably. Therefore sages go directly forth\nto good fortune, resolving this.]\nWu: He is surrounded by tangling vines and besieged with weariness. He says to himself:\n“If I would be regretful for doing nothing or doing something, I might as well do\nsomething to take my chances of getting out of hardship.”\nCOMMENTARY\nConfucius/Legge: Her spirit and action are unsuitable, but she repents of her former\nerrors and goes on to good fortune. Wilhelm/Baynes: He is not yet suitable. If there is\nremorse, this is an auspicious change. Blofeld: The entangling creepers are indicated by\nthe unsuitable position of this line. Feeling regret is a means to obtain good fortune.\nRitsema/Karcher: Not yet appropriate indeed. Significance moving indeed. Cleary\n(2): One has not hit the mark. There is regret because of regretting action; good fortune is\nto go. Wu: He is not responsive. This would be a good move.\nLegge: Line six is at the top of the figure, where the distress may be supposed to reach its\nheight. She appears bound and on a perilous summit, but her extremity is also her\nopportunity. She is moved to think of repenting, and if she does so and goes forward, all\nwill be fortunate.\nNOTES AND PARAPHRASES\nSiu: The man appears to be in the depths of distress. His fears and irresolute concerns\nover previous failures are not conducive to progress. But the oppressive bonds can be\nbroken if he repents of his error and grasps the situation firmly.\nWing: Do not allow difficulties in the recent past to create in you attitudes about the\nfuture. If you have become cynical or opinionated, you are lost. Improve your attitude, and\nthe situation will follow. Good fortune.\nEditor: The dominant idea is that the subject of the sixth line (\"at the top\") is fettered\nonly by vegetation which presumably could be cast off with little trouble. (This might\nsuggest a long-standing dilemma or limiting belief: vines and creepers only entangle those\nwho are not active enough get out of their way.) It follows that only the illusion that they\ncan't be cast off prevents liberation.\nOur common reaction to painful difficulty, consciously or unconsciously, is \"what\nhave I done to deserve this?\" \"How can I get out of this?\" \"How can there be a God\nif this is allowed to happen?\" Rarely do we ask, \"What new dimension of\nexperiencing does this try to teach me?\" \"Wherein am I being challenged?\"\nE.
